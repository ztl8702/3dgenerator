 - Simplified User Interface: only one-click required.
 - Photos taken by ordinary cameras can be used as inputs.
 
## Technical Details
 - Based on Anaglyph 3D. 
 - Two photos of certain objects taken from different angles are used as the input, filtered certain colors, and then overlaid over each other. 
 -  Uses multithreading to improves efficiency.

## Future Plans
 - Cross-platform compatibility
